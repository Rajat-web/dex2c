<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This project is a forked version of [amimo/dcc](https://github.com/amimo/dcc), which aims to make it easy for everyone to use this tool. We automated plenty of process that you had to do manually in original dcc. Moreover, we always try to add new features to make this tool more usable in real world applications.
Check out <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a> to know about the changes we made and also the changes we are planning to make in the feature.

### Built with


* ![Python][Python-Badge]
* [![Androguard][Androguard-Badge]][Androguard_Repository]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

Python 3.8 or higher is required for running this tool. So, make sure your python is up-to-date.

1. Clone the repo.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ratsan/dex2c
   ```
2. Open the cloned directory.
   ```bash
   cd dex2c
   ```
3. Download apktool latest version from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/) and save it in `tools` folder with name `apktool.jar`
   ```bash
   wget -O tools/apktool.jar https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/apktool_2.7.0.jar
   ```
4. <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads">Download</a> android NDK for your OS and extract it. Copy the folder path where `ndk-build` executable is located inside the extracted folder and configure `ndk_dir` in `dcc.cfg`

### Linux

1. Install required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Install JRE/JDK if you don't have it installed. Recommended jdk version is 11.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

### Windows

1. Install required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Install JRE/JDK from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html">oracle</a> if you don't have it installed. Search in google, how to install JDK in windows if you need more guidance on this topic. Recommended jdk version is 11.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Filters

Add all your filters in `filter.txt` file - one rule each line. Filters are are made using regex patterns. There are two types of filters avilable in dcc - whitelist, blacklist. Use them according to your need.

#### WhiteList

- Protect just one method in a specific class. It's just a demo.
```
com/some/class;some_method(some_parameters)return_type
```

- Protect all methods in a specific class. It's also just a demo.
```
com/some/class;.*
```

- Protect all methods in all classes under a package path. It's also just a demo.
```
com/some/package/.*;.*
```

- Protect a method with the name onCreate in all classes. It's also just a demo.
```
.*;onCreate\(.*
```

#### BlackList

Adding an exclamation `!` sign before a rule will mark that rule as a blacklist.

- Exclude one method in a specific class from being protected. It's just a demo.
```
!com/some/class;some_method(some_parameters)return_type
```

- Exclude all methods in a specific class from being protected. It's also just a demo.
```
!com/some/class;.*
```

- Exclude all methods in all classes under a package path from being protected. It's also just a demo.
```
!com/some/package/.*;.*
```

- Exclude a method with the name onCreate in all classes from being protected. It's also just a demo.
```
!.*;onCreate\(.*
```


### Protect apps

- Copy your apk file in `dex2c` folder where `dcc.py` is located and run this command.

```bash
python3 dcc.py -a input.apk -o output.apk
```

- Run this command to know about all the other options available in dcc to find the best ones for your need.

```bash
python3 dcc.py --help
```


<!-- CHANGE LIB NAME -->
## How to change lib name

Open `project/jni/Android.mk` file in cloned directory. You will find a variable named `LOCAL_MODULE`, which will initially have the value `stub`. Change it to your desired lib name. Keep in mind,
- Don't use spaces in lib name, use hyphen `-` or underscore `_`
- Don't use any other kind of symbols or punctuations in lib name
- Don't start lib name with the text `lib` itself



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Add custom lib loader
- [x] Add new apksigner
- [x] Add multi-dex support
- [x] Add app abi handler
- [x] Add signature configuration in `dcc.cfg`
- [x] Add new options
    - [x] --skip-synthetic
    - [x] --custom-loader
    - [x] --force-keep-libs
    - [x] --obfuscate
